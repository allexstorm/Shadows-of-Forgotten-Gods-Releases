## 💻 System Requirements

### ✅ Tested & runs smoothly on:

**Low-end laptop:**  
- **Model:** Lenovo V15 G2 IJL  
- **CPU:** Intel Celeron N4500 (2 cores @ 2.8 GHz)  
- **GPU:** Intel UHD Graphics (Jasper Lake)  
- **RAM:** 8 GB  
- **OS:** Ubuntu 24.04  
- **FPS:** ~60+ stable in P2P bot mode mode (no drops, no audio issues)

### 📦 Minimum Suggested:

- **CPU:** Dual Core 2.0 GHz or better  
- **GPU:** Integrated graphics (Intel HD 4000 or newer)  
- **RAM:** 4 GB  
- **OS:** Ubuntu 20.04+, Windows 7/10  
- **Storage:** < 100 MB
- **Input:** Keyboard + Mouse (no gamepad support in demo)

Note: FPS drops on very old PCs were only observed in the demo level with heavy parallax backgrounds.
In Bots/Arena mode, static layered backgrounds are used instead of parallax, resulting in smooth performance.
A toggle to disable parallax will be added in future versions for optimal performance on very old hardware.
